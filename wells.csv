This vessel is needed because the facility is on a different pad from the well. In the mean time we will be building containment for this vessel.

The gas detector was interfaced with a RigWatch electronic data recorder system. RigWatch provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas information from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely. Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill cutting samples at 30’ intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350’ to 11,175’ MD and 50’ samples from 11,175’ to TD (20,475’). Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain (broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing. RPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree "
