This vessel is needed because the facility is on a different pad from the well. In the mean time we will be building containment for this vessel.

RigWatch provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas information from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely. Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill cutting samples at 30’ intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350’ to 11,175’ MD and 50’ samples from 11,175’ to TD (20,475’). Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain (broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

Contact the appropriate NDIC Field Inspector to schedule the test. 2) The entire duration of the pressure test must be recorded on a chart recorder. 3) Pressure line to 100 psi. above the permitted maximum injection pressure and test for 30 minutes. Be sure to note the starting and ending pressures. 4) Depending on the results as determined by the NDIC: a. It may be necessary to shut in the pressurized line for 24 hours to stabilize temperature of test fluid and allow any air or gases to accumulate in order to be purged. b. Following the 24 hour shut-in period, re-pressurize line and document the amount of fluid needed to return pressure to l 00 psi. above the permitted maximum injection pressure. c.
